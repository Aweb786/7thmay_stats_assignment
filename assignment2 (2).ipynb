    " Q12 ans-->In a normal distribution (also known as a Gaussian distribution or bell curve), the three measures of central tendency—mean, median, and mode—tend to be very close to each other and are approximately equal. This is one of the characteristics that define a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how these measures relate to each other in a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: In a normal distribution, the mean is located at the center of the distribution, and the curve is symmetric around it. The mean is the arithmetic average of all data points, and it is also the balance point of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is also located at the center of a normal distribution. Since the distribution is symmetric, the median coincides with the mean. In other words, the median is the value that divides the distribution into two halves of equal area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: In a normal distribution, every value occurs with roughly the same frequency. As a result, there isn't a single mode—the distribution is considered to be multimodal, but all modes are located at the same value, which is the same as the mean and median.\n",
    "\n",
    "The close alignment of these measures in a normal distribution is a key reason why the normal distribution is often used as a model for many real-world phenomena. It simplifies calculations and predictions, and the symmetry allows for straightforward interpretations of probabilities and percentiles. However, it's important to note that in real data, deviations from perfect normality can occur, leading to slight differences between the mean, median, and mode.\n",

They can also increase measures of dispersion, making ranges, variances, and standard deviations larger than they might be without outliers.
